Projects deals with capturing data/logs from vechicles/truck over LTE/LoRa protocol to datastrem and eventually to datawarehouse. This data eventually feeds into AI pipeline which predicts Remaining Useful Life(RUL) of vehicles, which help in making decisions to repair/replace/modify parts. 

Main components of the projects: 
1. Edge-agent - To collect CAN/1553 bus logs from vehicles. 
2. Data-streaming - Collected logs are feed into this data-stream.
